   <p class="card-text">I started this off thinking I was going to stick to rules. Verb tense, person perspective, any others you can thunk. But forget all that nonsense this space is mine, don't misunderstand 
   you're welcome to be here, no seriously stay. It's just that I'm not about to do any mental gymnastics to make this purty for you or them because I don't want to and I'm not being paid. <br>
   They say there's only so many times in a life you can hit the reset button, but that's a damn lie and I'm semi-living proof. Not like I'm sick or diagnosed with anything, I just can't really call what I'm 
   doing right now living. There I go descarting with horses again(I am therefore I think). Listen things have gone tits up multiple times in my adult life, but I always bounce back. Truthfully, I've been in a
   deeper funk than even I was willing to admit.<br>
   You see something magical happened about a week ago. I spoke with a friend, a friend with whom I'ven't caught up with in a spell. Like before the original fracture of spirit. Someone who remembers the fresh-
   faced barely an adult me with stars in his eyes. During the course of our brief conversation she asked if, while doing all the other things I am to try and re-rail the train of my life, I was keeping up with 
   my writings because she always loved reading them so much.<br> 
   This isn't a phrase I'm unfamiliar hearing, but there's something about the clouds in your conscious that resist when it comes from those who've been by your side the whole time, and there was something
   special about those words coming from someone who's trusted but been absent for all the shithole scaling you've had to do to keep your head above ground. As though being from the before when all the skies 
   were blue, she brought those blue skies back.<br><br>
   What I'm Saying is Thanks LW<br><br>
   Well with that fun business out of the way what should we talk about today? Oh is the world on fire?! Holy Shit it totally is. Well damn, there's not much we can do here. let's all take a minute to daydream.
   Because it's my favorite hobby, that's why, <s>Billiam</s>. Honestly I don't know what I'm doing here, I know what I'd like to do. and someday I'm sure I'll get there. Look it took me a week to make the damn 
   thing look like this and it's still not the way I really want it. Give me a damn break, I built this from scratch, did I do a ton of googling along the way? Do Bears wear funny hats? Did I do a lot of trial
   and error? Does the Pope poop in woods? I'm newish to this stuff, I first dabbled back when we were all confined to our dwellings&#8212remember the last year with a Feb 29th? Now I'm learning all about the
   security side of things so I can make sure I keep all the gremlins out of my stuff and hopefully get a better job so I can work on this more in my downtime instead of just drinking the depression away.<br>
   What were we talking about, oh right, the true dream for this page here is something wildly different than what you're currently seeing, although I kinda like the aesthetic, that might stay. For now I think
   while I work on the infrastructure to fulfill this site's actual destiny, I'll keep hopping on here randomly to scribble some gibberish about whatever's in my brain at the time. <br><br>Good with You?
   <br><br>I'm kidding I don't care.<br><br><br></p>

            Second Scrawl

    </header>
    <p class="card-text">So here's the thing about me I'd like to change the most: I'm overly passionate. This often manifests as me diving head first into something that interests me only to quickly grow bored
     once I realize that I'm not an immediate master. I've owned this domain with a plan for what I want this site to be for 18 months and while this is nothing near my final vision it is at least something. Of 
     course, upon seeing the first entry out there live for the whole world to gaze upon my works and weep, that circus boy with his pretty new pet came jojoing right to the surface. This ethereal devotion has 
     always made me question if I was someone with adhd or autism, however my mother the early childhood specialist on development claims I'm not, I was never tested so I still have my doubts. It's all a spectrum 
     anyway right.<br><br>
     I'm trying to be better which is why I avoided writing anything the past two days. See I know I could write something each day or even every few hours right now. But that would lead to a rapid burnout which
     would mean in less than two months I would ignore this completely and then nothing would get done for another two years. And honestly I just don't want to be that guy anymore. <br><br>
     Speaking of guys I'm not trying to be anymore, did I tell you during the past 3 years I've managed to put on a whole second person? Well not quite, but at the start of the panini I was carrying an extra twenty 
     to thirty pounds. Over the following three years I managed to pack on another hundo until I plateau'd in September at 295, I've managed to hover at that number for a year now. I want nothing more than to be 
     on track to a healthy 165-175 by my fortieth birthday which is ten months away. As I mentioned before I've got to not dive in head first or I'll get discouraged when I haven't shed 50lbs in six weeks.<br><br>
     I don't think I have anything else to say on the matter, except wish me luck.<br><br>Or don't, if you wanna be a dick about it<br><br><br></p>

     Third Rant
    </span>
   </header>
   <p class="card-text">Good Goddess did I used to love starting the day by reading the paper. I might still like it, I don't know I haven't done it in a long time, we're talking almost two decades. Maybe I 
    wouldn't like the paper as my morning routine anymore for a number of factors. The largest being the last time I had a habit of reading the local paper most weren't owned by major media empires, backed by 
    soulless corporations owned by ever worsening examples of humanity. But most of what I enjoyed back when, was the tactile feeling of holding, folding, reading (unlike most) straight through letting my mind 
    have to connect the stories that spanned multiple pages because I didn't want to read them in order, I wanted the snippets mixed in together. <br><br> 
    Of course this was when the paper was much more substance than sponsor. And multiple sections took five or more pages. And that's not including the classifieds, which were their own section! These days it seems 
    if you stripped out all the advertisements, you'd have a total of 5 pages left and two of those would be sports scores and comics strips.<br><br> 
    Less isn't happening in our world so what's happened to the glory days of the newspaper? Where are the stories about what's happening in the capitol building of my state? I want a robust metro section to rival 
    the A pages, which should cover Federal and International happenings only. Give me a sports section with loads of commentary both local and broad, cover high school happenings in the area. And cover all sports 
    not just the ones that happen on television.<br><br> 
    Ideally what I driving at here is that I miss when the metro section rivaled the front, when sports balanced with special interest(which was also it's own section) and on Sundays the whole damn thing could 
    kill a small mammal if dropped from the second story. Honestly I don't know if that was ever true, but I remember the heft of those Sunday papers and they damn sure felt hazardous to miniature wildlife.<br><br>
    But my absolute favorite, the very best thing about the paper, Sadly has grown to become what can only be described as an eldritch horror.<br><br> 
    That's correct, I'm talking about the opinion page. And it was a single page. Sure there were Columnists who had weekly pieces mixed into their section of expertise, but opinion was just one damn page. It had 
    two long pieces: one by an expert of whatever subject, the other by a leader or notable of whatever industry; typically. Then there were two shorter pieces each representing a side of something local or recent 
    by regular ol' civilians, your neighbors. It was beautiful; a snippet of public subjectivity in a sea of objective reporting.<br><br> 
    When I was young, having cable wasn't by any means standard, but it also wasn't all that surprising. Like having a computer in your home, you were doing well. Then computers and cable some how became standard 
    for the middle class when I was in middle school and the rise of the 24 hour cycle began (clutch your pearls, harder than that!). <br><br>
    People love to blame the rise of all day news broadcast for a lot of things, but there's enough happening in the world to report objectively on a whole day's events. The issue is the people who own these news 
    churning beasts, don't want certain stories told, so they focus on the ones you're allowed to hear, then they hyperfocus, then they've said everything there is to say factually, and there's still 17 hours left. <br><br> 
    What to fill it with, Advertisements like everywhere else in life? Anyone else remember when people were getting face tattoos of company sponsors? <br><br>
    Nope, hire more opinion jackals. Let the Op-Ed grow and feast on our dwindling media literacy until there's nothing but husks of humans wandering around debating what is actually fact. In a short time, we'll 
    have large portions of the population believing the earth is flat again because an MTV side character was allowed to say it is on a <q>News</q> program.<br><br> 
    Do vaccines cause autism, welp a former playboy model said it happened to her son on a talk show, personal anecdotes are now the foundation of causation!<br><br>
    Some crack pot wrote an email accusing an entire local population of something horrendous and it was shared, liked, and reposted all through the great opinion is truth monster until a candidate screamed it 
    during a debate, while all the rational people now chuckle at this man's idiocy, an alarming percent of our peers believe that fiction to be fact. Because after all it was on the <q>News</q><br><br> 
    Opinion v. Reporting was easy to spot when the paper put <b>OPINION</b> as the header on the page. But now we have shows which last multiple hours a day purporting to be news which consist of one or more 
    people spouting off their personal views. Sadly for too many of us, it's easy to believe they're are reporting real facts because they're saying what we want to hear, and nothing's nicer then being told you're right.<br><br>
    ...right?<br><br><br>
