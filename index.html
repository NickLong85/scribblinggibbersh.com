   <p class="card-text">I started this off thinking I was going to stick to rules. Verb tense, person perspective, any others you can thunk. But forget all that nonsense this space is mine, don't misunderstand 
   you're welcome to be here, no seriously stay. It's just that I'm not about to do any mental gymnastics to make this purty for you or them because I don't want to and I'm not being paid. <br>
   They say there's only so many times in a life you can hit the reset button, but that's a damn lie and I'm semi-living proof. Not like I'm sick or diagnosed with anything, I just can't really call what I'm 
   doing right now living. There I go descarting with horses again(I am therefore I think). Listen things have gone tits up multiple times in my adult life, but I always bounce back. Truthfully, I've been in a
   deeper funk than even I was willing to admit.<br>
   You see something magical happened about a week ago. I spoke with a friend, a friend with whom I'ven't caught up with in a spell. Like before the original fracture of spirit. Someone who remembers the fresh-
   faced barely an adult me with stars in his eyes. During the course of our brief conversation she asked if, while doing all the other things I am to try and re-rail the train of my life, I was keeping up with 
   my writings because she always loved reading them so much.<br> 
   This isn't a phrase I'm unfamiliar hearing, but there's something about the clouds in your conscience that resist when it comes from those who've been by your side the whole time, and there was something
   special about those words coming from someone who's trusted but been absent for all the shithole scaling you've had to do to keep your head above ground. As though being from the before when all the skies 
   were blue, she brought those blue skies back.<br>
  <br>What I'm Saying is Thanks LW<br><br>
   Well with that fun business out of the way what should we talk about today? Oh is the world on fire?! Holy Shit it totally is. Well damn, there's not much we can do here. let's all take a minute to daydream.
   Because it's my favorite hobby, that's why, <s>Billiam</s>. Honestly I don't know what I'm doing here, I know what I'd like to do. and someday I'm sure I'll get there. Look it took me a week to make the damn 
   thing look like this and it's still not the way I really want it. Give me a damn break, I built this from scratch, did I do a ton of googling along the way? Do Bears wear funny hats? Did I do a lot of trial
   and error? Does the Pope poop in woods? I'm newish to this stuff, I first dabbled back when we were all confined to our dwellings&#8212remember the last year with a Feb 29th? Now I'm learning all about the
   security side of things so I can make sure I keep all the gremlins out of my stuff and hopefully get a better job so I can work on this more in my downtime instead of just drinking the depression away.<br>
   What were we talking about, oh right, the true dream for this page here is something wildly different than what you're currently seeing, although I kinda like the aesthetic, that might stay. For now I think
   while I work on the infrastructure to fulfill this site's actual destiny, I'll keep hoping on here randomly to scribble some gibberish about whatever's in my brain at the time. <br><br>Good with You?
   <br><br>I'm kidding I don't care.<br><br></p>
